# Isolated-DC-DC-Battery-Charger

In this project we designed an isolated DC-DC battery charger for the specs given below. There is no limitiation to use any topology. 

Specs:
Specifications of the project are listed as follows:

Minimum Input Voltage: 20 V
Maximum Input Voltage: 40 V
Output Voltage: 12 V
Output Power: 60 W
Output Voltage Peak-to-Peak Ripple: 3%
Line Regulation(Deviation of percent output voltage when input voltage is changed from its minimum to maximum or vice versa): 3%
Load Regulation(Deviation of percent output voltage when load current is changed from 10% to 100% or vice versa): 3%
Closed loop control is a must. Projects without a closed loop control will not be accepted.
